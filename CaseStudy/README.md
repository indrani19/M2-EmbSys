# CASE STUDY 1: Sun Tracking Solar Panel



## Introduction:
- Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.
- The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent.
- This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun
- In this project, we will see a simple Sun Tracking Solar Panel circuit which will track the Sun and position the solar panels accordingly.




### Requirements
- The Sun tracking solar panel consists of two LDRs, solar panel and a servo motor and ATmega328 Micro controller.
- Two light dependent resistors are arranged on the edges of the solar panel. 
- Light dependent resistors produce low resistance when light falls on them. 
- The servo motor connected to the panel rotates the panel in the direction of Sun.
- When the intensity of the light falling on right LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards right and if intensity on the left LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards left. 
- In the noon time, Sun is ahead and intensity of light on both the panels is same. In such cases, panel is constant and there is no rotation.

### Components 
| components names| Quantity|Description|
|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| Solar panel|1|Solar panel consists of photovoltaic cells arranged in an order. Photovoltaic cell is nothing but a solar cell. Solar cell is made up of semiconductor material silicon.The bottom of solar panel is connected to Servo motor.|
|ATmega328 Micro Controller|1|It is an 8-bit controller. It has 32K Bytes of Programmable Flash memory, 1K Bytes of EEPROM and 2K Bytes of SRAM. It has 23 programmable I/O pins.|
|Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)|2|Light Dependent Resistors or LDRs are the resistors whose resistance values depend on intensity of the light. As the intensity of light falling on the LDR increases, resistance value decreases. In dark, LDR will have maximum resistance.|
|Resistiors|3| |
|Servo Motor|1|Servo motor is used to rotate the panel. To drive the servo motor, a PWM Signal must be provided to its control pin and hence Pin 17 (which has PWM) is connected to the control pin of the servo motor.|
|Battery|1|By connecting a battery to the solar panel, you can store the energy generated by the solar cells and this energy can be used when required.|





### Applications
- These panels can be used to power the traffic lights and streetlights
- These can be used in home to power the appliances using solar power.
- These can be used in industries as more energy can be saved by rotating the panel.



### Advantages
- The solar energy can be reused as it is non-renewable resource.
- This also saves money as there is no need to pay for energy used (excluding the initial setup cost).
- Helps in maximizing the solar energy absorption by continuously tracking the sun.











# CASE STUDY 2: Embedded Rain-Sensing System



## Introduction
- The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate 
rain wipers without driver interaction. 
- Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, train locomotives etc are equipped with such wipers, which are usually a important requirement.



## Requirements
- In rainy days we suffer from sprinkling of water on front glass of vehicle. 
Due to this sprinkling of water on windshield glass the driver cannot see other vehicles on road clearly
- So he tries operating wiper on glass, for that
he should often switch on for operating wiper and due to the distraction from the road there is a possibility for an accident to occur.
- This accident can be avoided by placing a sensor which senses the sprinkling of water and sends signals to automatically operate the wiper.
- The main requirement of this project is when the water hit the sensor, it will send signal to the system thus moving the
wiper motor. Once sensor did not detect any water, the wiper will stop.

- Rain Sensor:
The most common modern rain sensors are based on the principle of total internal
reflection: an infrared light is beamed at a 45-degree angle into the windshield from
the interior — if the glass is wet, less light makes it back to the sensor, and the wipers
turn on.
- DC Motor:
This is used for controlling the direction and the speed of the wiper. It actuates whenever it
receives signal from the control circuit to operate the wiper.
- Attiny-85:
ATtiny85 is an 8-bit AVR microcontroller that comes with 8-pin interface and mainly used in automation and Arduino projects.
- Arduino Mega:The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560.It has 54 digital input/output pins.Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer
