# Sun Tracking Solar Panel


## Introduction:
- Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.
- The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent.
- This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun
- In this project, we will see a simple Sun Tracking Solar Panel circuit which will track the Sun and position the solar panels accordingly.


### Principle of Sun Tracking Solar Panel
- The Sun tracking solar panel consists of two LDRs, solar panel and a servo motor and ATmega328 Micro controller.
- Two light dependent resistors are arranged on the edges of the solar panel. 
- Light dependent resistors produce low resistance when light falls on them. 
- The servo motor connected to the panel rotates the panel in the direction of Sun.
- When the intensity of the light falling on right LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards right and if intensity on the left LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards left. 
- In the noon time, Sun is ahead and intensity of light on both the panels is same. In such cases, panel is constant and there is no rotation.

### Applications
- These panels can be used to power the traffic lights and streetlights
- These can be used in home to power the appliances using solar power.
- These can be used in industries as more energy can be saved by rotating the panel.

### Advantages
- The solar energy can be reused as it is non-renewable resource.
- This also saves money as there is no need to pay for energy used (excluding the initial setup cost)
- Helps in maximizing the solar energy absorption by continuously tracking the sun.
