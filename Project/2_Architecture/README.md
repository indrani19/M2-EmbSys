## 1.1 SENSORS USED
- ### Ultrasonic sensor:
  The ultrasonic sensor is a very low-cost device and has found its application in most areas of autonomous robots and cars. When an ultrasonic sensor is induced with voltage, it generates sound waves that are emitted through the emitter component of the sensor. The generated sound waves are inaudible to humans (frequency of 20Hz to GHz). The waves travel until such length that they are reflected back. The reflected waves are picked up by the receiver component of the sensor.
  
## 1.2 ACTUATORS
- ### Servo motor:
The component of the machine or devices that are responsible for moving, controlling or effecting a certain change on a mechanism or system. The actuator requires a control signal which comes from the microcontroller and a source of energy.
- ### Dc motor:
Dc motor is used to control the throttle pedal of the system.

## 1.3 MICRO CONTROLLER
- ### Aurdino : 
This is the main component which controls all the above mentioned parts of our embedded system. This interfaces all the sensors and actuators.
