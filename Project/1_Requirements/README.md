# Collision Avoidance System (CAS) for Automobiles using Embedded System 

# 1 About CAS

## 1.1 Abstract:
- The study address the problem of slow reaction time to braking by implementing a collision avoidance system tfixed that aids the driver in ensuring safety. 
The system consists of the autonomous car and the collision avoidance system. 
Based on the signal received from the ultrasonic sensor, the micro controller unit sends a signal to the braking unit for applying the brake automatically as per
braking & throttle control logic fed in to the micro controller unit. To avoid the collision between the
vehicles during the period of running conditions and automatically applying the brake by means of actuators, distance measuring sensors & Electronic control module.


## 1.2 Introduction:
- Nowadays, the number of accidents is so high
and uncertain. Accidents causes worst damage. These accidents are mostly caused by delay of
the driver to hit the brake.
- Collision avoidance systems concentrates on advanced ideas
such as pre-crash sensing, an ultrasonic sensor is used to
sense the object in front of the vehicle and gives the signal to
the microcontroller unit.
- Based on the signal received from
the ultrasonic sensor, the microcontroller unit sends a signal
to the braking unit for applying the brake automatically.


## 1.3 Objectives:
- To design an obstacle sensor system. 
- To develop a system that applies to brake at a safety distance.
- To ensure the system responds in real-time
