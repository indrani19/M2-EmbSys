# Collision Avoidance System (CAS) for Automobiles using Embedded System 

# 1 About CAS

## 1.1 Abstract:
- The study address the problem of slow reaction time to braking by implementing a collision avoidance system tfixed that aids the driver in ensuring safety. 
The system consists of the autonomous car and the collision avoidance system. 
 Based on the signal received from the ultrasonic
sensor, the micro controller unit sends a signal to the braking unit for applying the brake automatically as per
braking & throttle control logic fed in to the micro controller unit. To avoid the collision between the
vehicles during the period of running conditions and automatically applying the brake by means of actuators,
Distance measuring sensors & Electronic control module.
