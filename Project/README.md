# Automatic Braking System


## Introduction
- An automatic Braking system is an intelligent mechatronic system includes an Ultrasonic wave emitter provided on the front portion of a car producing and emitting Ultrasonic waves. 
- An Ultrasonic receiver is also placed on the front portion  of  the  car  operatively  receiving  a  reflective  Ultrasonic  wave  signal. 
- The  reflected  wave  (detected  pulse)  gives the  distance  between  the  obstacle and  the  vehicle. 
- Then  a  microcontroller  is  used  to  control  the  speed  of  the vehicle based on the detection pulse information to push the brake pedal and apply brake to the car stupendously for safety purpose


## Requirements
- To develop an Intelligent Braking System for Automobiles.
- To  find  the  braking  distance  at  various vehicle  speeds  as  well  as  minimum  distance before collision
- After detecting an obstacle according to the distance the system shall stop the vehicle
